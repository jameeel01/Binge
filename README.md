<a href="https://binge-94730.web.app/">Website Link</a>

## Overview
- Binge is a client-side JavaScript web application designed to help users discover new restaurants through location based searching and interactive swiping. Users can explore nearby restaurants using a live map and filters, or swipe through personalized restaurant recommendations.
- Originally developed for the COMP 1800 course at BCIT, this project applies User-Centred Design principles, agile project management, and integrates Firebase backend services to store user preferences such as saved restaurants (“Craves”) and rejected options (“Leftovers”).
